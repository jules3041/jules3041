##  About

Engineering student at **ENSAE Paris** on a gap year, passionate about applying machine learning to systems with concrete societal impact.

My path went from economics -> market finance -> data science. I decided to change education to follow what I love : models and applied AI.

## Featured Projects

### [`Internship-GRETTIA-Caveat`](https://github.com/jules3041/Internship-GRETTIA-Caveat) — Household-Level CVAE for Mobility Synthesis
> *GRETTIA Lab · Université Gustave Eiffel · 2025–2026*

Extending the [CAVEAT](https://github.com/big-ucl/caveat) framework to model **intra-household interactions** in daily activity schedules, going beyond individual simulation toward socially-aware generative models.

- **Hierarchical CVAE** with coordination + individual latent spaces
- **Cross-member masked attention** to capture joint activities and shared trips
- Explicit **interaction supervision** with a dual-output branch (schedules + interaction logits)
- Evaluation via Earth Mover's Distance, UMAP latent diagnostics, and interaction overlap metrics

### [`HappyHR`](https://github.com/aayrapet/HappyHR) — AI Voice Interview Platform
> *HackEurope 2026 · ~20 hours · 4 contributors*

AI-powered recruiter that screens CVs and conducts **live voice interviews** with an animated 3D avatar: built end-to-end at a hackathon.

- CV screening with **spaCy + SentenceTransformers** (semantic + lexical hybrid)
- Voice interview via **OpenAI GPT Realtime API** with custom tool-call schema
- Post-interview scoring agent with **Gemini 2.5 Flash** → structured JSON (per-question scores, red flags, recommendation)
- Full pipeline: apply → screen → email invite → interview → HR dashboard → decision

### [`PY-Gaz-Consumption-Prediction`](https://github.com/moranenzo/PY-Gaz-Consumption-Prediction) — National Gas Forecasting
> *STATAPP @ ENSAE Paris · ENGIE collaboration · Reviewed by A. Tsybakov (CREST)*

ML pipeline for **daily residential gas consumption forecasting** in France, with special focus on reducing errors on atypical days (holidays, weekends).

Reduced global MAPE by -19% and holiday MAPE by -29% through holiday oversampling, Optuna-tuned AutoML, and a 14-model ensemble.

### [`Projet_datascience_ensae`](https://github.com/ainomi/Projet_datascience_ensae) — Paris Real Estate Price Prediction
> *Data Science Project @ ENSAE Paris*

End-to-end pipeline from **custom web scraping** to price prediction for Paris apartments.

- Built a **Selenium scraper** targeting Bien'ici (ORPI, Nexity, Century 21 listings)
- Feature engineering with geocoding (geopy + folium), spatial features
- Models: XGBoost + scikit-learn pipelines
